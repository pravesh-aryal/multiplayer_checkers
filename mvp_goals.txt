-> A N X N board is displayed for both users who login and are connected to a game. 
-> If user 1 clicks on square, it is updated (echoed for both users on that game).


Flow of the website
1. User goes to www.checkers.com -> sees two options sign up or login. 
2. No database is used for MVP user info is kept in an array. User signs up or logs in or plays as a guest.
3. When logged in user gets a button to start a game (player vs player only on MVP), now the started games goes onto games[], where if there are N games when other player logs in and clicks on start a game, the player is random connected to a game.
        if there exists a game which is not FULL connect the second player to the game. 
4. When either of the player clicks a square, the change is broadcasted to each player real time, is saved on a DB which is just an arr/file in this case, and the moves can be traced back easily. (this feature to implement later than mvp)
5. Solution may not be optimal.
